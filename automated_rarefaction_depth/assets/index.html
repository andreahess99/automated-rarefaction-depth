            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    The Rarefaction Curves plot on the left shows the {{ graph_data }}
                    at each depth for every sample as a curve. The shaded area represents the specified acceptable
                    range of rarefaction depths. The optimal rarefaction depth is depicted as the vertical line named knee point. 
                    It is the knee point that was calculated using the specified algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Histogram of {{ graph_name }} per Sample on the right shows the number of samples which have a certain number of reads.
                    The grey bars are the samples that would be excluded if the rarefaction depth was set to the knee point, the blue bars the ones included.
                    (This is the case if the slider hasn't been moved, otherwise it shows the same but with respect to the slider.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zoom in and out of the plots for more or less details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click on the checkbox above the plots to show the line with the rarefaction depth according to the slider.
                    Move the slider to change the black rarefaction depth line accordingly. Additionally, the bars in the barplot 
                    on the right are blue if the sample has a read count above the specified rarefaction depth, meaning that
                    sample would be included if this rarefaction depth was chosen, otherwise the bars are grey. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below the plots the knee point and the knee point Â±5% is specified and at what percentiles those points lie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ATTENTION! The acceptable range of rarefaction depths is set to keeping at least {{ percent_samples_100 }}% of all samples. 
                    The sensitivity of the kneedle algorithm is set to 3, and the evaluated depths are linearly spaced between 
                    1 and the read depth of the sample at the {{ max_read_percentile }}th percentile.

                    The shaded area is where at least {{ percent_samples_100 }}% of the samples
                    are kept, if used as the rarefaction depth.

                        The upper bound of the acceptable range (keeping at least {{ percent_samples_100 }}% of the samples) is {{ depth_threshold }}.<br>
                        If the calculated knee point is used, {{ percentile }}% of the samples will
                        be excluded because they have too little reads.
